This is the command-line client for the [Valohai][vh] machine learning IaaS platform.

Installation
------------

`valohai-cli` supports Python 2.7 or Python 3.4 and higher. We recommend Python 3.

The easiest way to get started is to install `valohai-cli` system-wide with `pip`.

```bash
$ pip3 install valohai-cli  # (or pip2)
```

After you've installed the client, `vh` should work and you should see a description
of commands.

> If you want to keep your global Python package environment clean,
we recommend installing `valohai-cli` in a virtualenv.  You can still access the command
from anywhere on your system by creating a symlink or alias to the `bin/vh` file.

Getting Started
---------------
